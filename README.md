# Both tasks should be completed

## Task 1
For a given input, write a function that return the number of times the letter 'a' can be added to it before the string 'aaa' is present in the word e.g. for the string aabab, the letter 'a' can be added three times so as to make aabaabaa, so your function should return 3.

More sample inputs  
The string 'dog' can become 'aadaaoaagaa', so your function should return 8.
The string 'baaaa' already contains 'aaa', in this case your function should return -1.  
The string 'aa' cannot have any 'a's added to it before it becomes 'aaa', in this case your function should return 0.

## Task 2  
For a given array of strings, write a function that calculates the length of the longest string that can be assembled by combining elements of the array and that does not contain any repeated letters.

Sample inputs  
If the array is 'ezy', 'jnx', 'btp' the longest string that can be assembled is 9 characters long.
If the array is made up of 'co', 'dil' and 'ity', the longest strings that can be produced are codil, coity, dilco and ityco, so your function should return 5.  
If the array is made up of 'banana', 'racecar' and 'potato', there are no strings that can be assembled without repeating letters, so your function should return -1.
